# Animal Competition - Assignment

## Objectives

The goal for you to complete this assignment is for you to:

1. Practice Object Oriented Programming (OOP) using concepts of abstraction and separation of concerns
2. General programming best practices:
   1. Naming conventions
   1. Documentation
   1. [DRY principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)
3. Practice using Version Control Systems (VCS) like Git

## Synopsis

In role-playing games (RPG) like Dungeon and Dragons and Pokemon, a common scenario is for two entities to compete in a head-to-head battle. The general requirement for this assignment is to build on the **OOP with Animals templates** and **create a game** that pits 2 animals in (friendly) competition and determine a winner based on your own creative algorithm.

## Requirements

1. As the **game designer**, I want the algorithm (that will determine the winner/score) to be **secret**, so that **players will be challenged** in trying to figure out which features and circumstances would make one animal better than another
2. As the **game designer**, I want the algorithm to take into account the **environment**, so that **players will be challenged** in trying to figure out which features and circumstances would make one animal better than another
   1. For example, in a “night-time” environment, vision and hearing may be more important traits than speed; in a “desert” environment, animals that require less water may be stronger than animals that require more water; etc.
3. As a **player**, I want to **play by myself** to configure 2 animals and have them face-off to see the winners (and scores), so that I can **iteratively try to figure out the optimal animal features**
4. As a **player**, I want to **play against another player**–each configuring their own animal–and have them face off to show that I have the better animal
5. As a **player**, I want to **configure an animal as easily as possible**, with very little typing or no typing at all, so that I can quickly try different combinations to see which features make an animal stronger.

## Instructions

1. This assignment can be completed **individually** or in **groups of two or three**
2. Advice: **start small**, then build up. Eg. start by including only 1 or 2 features and 1 or 2 environments in your algorithm
3. Your source code and documentation should be **stored in a public project/repository on GitHub.com** (or equivalent)
4. **Add your teacher** to the project as a team member
5. Do all your work in a **new branch called “assignment”**
6. Whenever you are ready to have your code reviewed by the teacher **create a pull-request** from the “assignment” branch into the “main” branch and **assign the pull-request to the teacher**
   1. Your teachers will give you **feedback using comments** in the pull-request
   2. You can **update** the pull-requests or create new pull-requests **as often as you like** until the assignment deadline
   3. If working in a group, **each member** must submit **at least one pull-request**

## Evaluation

The following rubric will be used to evaluate this assignment. Please keep in mind that: _Good Enough… is Rarely Good. And it is Never Great. Be Great._
